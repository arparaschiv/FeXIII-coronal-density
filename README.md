# FeXIII-coronal-density 


#### **Main Aim:** 
Small example notebooks that can be used to infer FE XIII coronal densities using a Chianti calculation look-up table. Target lines are the Fe XIII 1074.6nm and 1079.8nm pair 

#### Separate notebooks particularized for distinct data types/sources exist for:

1. NSO's DKIST Cryo-NIRSP or DL-NIRSP slit and imaging spectro-polarimeters
2. HAO's MLSO CoMP/uCoMP imaging full-disk polarimetric coronagraph

### **Notes:**
- Spatio-temporal matching observations in both Fe XIII infrared lines are required.  
- DKIST example offers a parallel implementation making calculations fast.
- Options for processing either peak line emission or integrated line emission exist.
- Accurate header and pointing information are required.
- Currently, the lookup table is created against CHIANTI V10.
